### BetterWasteTank:
> Improves the wastetank by making the suit use the full potential of the canisters capacity.
> Changes heating affect by lowering the amount of waste that goes into the waste tank when cooling the suit by 3 times.

### DetailedPlayerInfo *(currently buggy)*:
> Makes the info windows on the bottom right more accurate by adding decimals to them.
> You can also quickly change between viewing celsius and kelvin temperatures by pressing "K" ingame.

### ExternalSuitReader:
> Makes the advanced suit have the ability to read the external atmosphere of which the suit is in.
> You can read the ratios via "RatioOxygenOutput" or "RatioPollutantsOutput", you can change "Oxygen" and "Pollutants" to any of the other gas types!

### InstantPlants:
> Makes plants grow as fast as possible when planted.
> Good for people that just want to focus on building and less on trying to grow plants.

### NoFractionalReagents *(mostly untested)*
> Makes reagent mixes not have annoying decimal places.
